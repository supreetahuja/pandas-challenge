# School Student Performance Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes the performance of various schools based on student data. The dataset includes information on school type, total number of students, total school budget, per student budget, average math and reading scores, as well as the percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall. The analysis aims to gain insights into the academic performance of different schools and compare the performance between school types.

## Analysis Summary
The analysis of the given data reveals significant differences in academic performance based on school type, school budget, and school size. Charter schools consistently outperform district schools, indicating that school type plays a crucial role in student achievement. Schools with higher per student budgets exhibit better academic outcomes, while smaller schools tend to have higher average scores and passing percentages.

## Comparisons and Conclusions
Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:
- Charter schools demonstrate higher academic performance compared to district schools.
- Adequate school budgets positively influence student achievement.
- Smaller schools provide a more conducive learning environment for students.

The findings highlight the importance of school type, budget allocation, and school size in promoting student success. These insights can guide policymakers, educators, and stakeholders in making informed decisions to improve educational outcomes.

## Repository Contents
- `PyCitySchools` Folder: Containing 'PyCitySchools.ipynb' file containing the code, '2 Conclusions.txt', 'Analysis_Summary.txt' file and Readme.md. 
- `Resources' folder: Contains 2 CSV files 'schools_complete' and 'students_complete' - The original dataset used for the analysis.
- `Readme.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its findings.

## Instructions
To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies library - Pandas.
3. Open the `PyCitySchools.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Read both the files from the Resources folder and merge them.
4. Run each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate the results.
